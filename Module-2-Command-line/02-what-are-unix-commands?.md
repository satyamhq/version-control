# What Are Unix Commands?

Unix commands are text-based instructions used to interact with an operating system through a command-line interface (CLI). They perform the same actions as a graphical user interface (GUI), but in a more direct, powerful, and efficient way.

## GUI vs Command Line

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Users interact with their devices by clicking, tapping, scrolling, and swiping. The GUI is a visual layer that makes computers easy to use for non-technical users.

Example:
Right-click → New Folder

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
Developers often use the command line to perform tasks using text-based commands.

Example:
mkdir new-folder

## Why Unix Commands Are Important

Most companies run their applications on the cloud, and a large majority of cloud systems run on Linux. Linux is based on Unix, which makes Unix commands a critical skill for developers.

Unix commands provide:
- Faster workflows
- Better system control
- Essential skills for software development, cloud computing, and DevOps

## Brief History

Unix was developed in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Labs.

Linux was developed later by Linus Torvalds as a hobby project and was inspired by Unix. Today, Linux powers most servers and cloud platforms.

## Getting Help with Commands

Every Unix command includes built-in documentation.

Example:
man ls

The `man` command displays the manual page for a command, explaining how it works and which options are available.

## Flags in Unix Commands

Flags are options that modify the behavior of a command.

Example:
ls -l
This displays files in a detailed list format, including permissions and ownership.

ls -a
This displays all files and directories, including hidden files.

## Common Unix Commands

cd    - Change directory  
ls    - List files and directories  
pwd   - Print the current directory path  
mkdir - Create a new folder  
cp    - Copy files or directories  
mv    - Move or rename files  

## Key Takeaways

Unix commands work behind the scenes of graphical interfaces. Learning them gives developers more control, speed, and flexibility when working with computers and servers.
