# Using Bash on Mac Terminal

## Learning Objectives

Learners will understand how to open the command line (Terminal) on macOS and become familiar with the most common Bash commands.

## Mac Terminal

The Terminal on macOS allows users to interact with the operating system through typed commands instead of graphical actions. It provides powerful control over files, programs, and system operations.

The Terminal can be opened in three ways: Finder, Launch Pad, and Spotlight.

## Opening Terminal Using Finder

Open Finder from the Dock. Click Applications in the left-hand panel, then open the Utilities folder. Inside Utilities, select the Terminal application to open it.

## Opening Terminal Using Launch Pad

Press the F4 key to open Launch Pad. Use the search bar and type `Term`. When the Terminal icon appears, select it to open the Terminal.

## Opening Terminal Using Spotlight

Press the Command key and the Space bar together to open Spotlight search. Type `Terminal` or `Term`. When the Terminal icon appears, select it to open the Terminal.

## Bash Commands

Bash provides commands for navigating the file system, viewing file contents, and managing files and directories.

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| cd | Change directory |
| ls | List directory contents |
| rm | Remove files or directories |
| mv | Move or rename files and folders |
| touch | Create a new empty file or update a file timestamp |
| cp | Copy files or folders |
| mkdir | Create a new directory |
| pwd | Display the current working directory |
| cat | Display or concatenate file contents |
| less | View file contents one page at a time |
| grep | Search for text within files or directories |

## Flags

Flags are options added to commands to modify their behavior. For example, the `ls` command lists directory contents.

ls

Using a flag:

ls -l

The `-l` flag displays detailed information such as file permissions, ownership, file size, and modification date.

## Man Pages

Every Bash command has a manual page, also known as a man page. Man pages describe how a command works and list all available flags and options.

man ls

Man pages are useful for learning new commands and reviewing command usage.

## Editing Files in Bash

Bash supports several text editors. The most commonly used are VI and Vim.

VI stands for Visual Editor. Vim stands for Visual Editor Improved. These editors allow users to edit and save files directly from the Terminal.

## Vim Modes

Vim uses different modes to perform actions.

### Normal Mode

Normal mode is the default mode when a file is opened. It is used for navigation and command execution.

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| h | Move left |
| j | Move down |
| k | Move up |
| l | Move right |
| /search_term | Search text |

### Insert Mode

Insert mode allows direct editing of file contents. It can be entered by pressing `i` to insert, `a` to append, or `o` to open a new line.

### Command Line Mode

Command Line mode is used to save files and exit the editor. It is entered by typing `:` while in Normal mode.

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| :w | Save the file |
| :q | Quit the editor |

## Key Takeaways

The Terminal provides direct access to macOS system functionality. Bash commands allow efficient file and system management, flags customize command behavior, man pages help users learn commands, and Vim enables powerful text editing directly from the command line.
