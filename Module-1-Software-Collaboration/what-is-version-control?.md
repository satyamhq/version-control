# What Is Version Control?

## Introduction
Version control is like a **time machine for developers**. It allows them to track changes made to files and return to previous versions whenever needed. It is also known as **source control** or **source code management (SCM)**.

---

## Definition
Version control is a system that records all changes made to files over time. These changes include:
- Adding new files
- Modifying existing files
- Deleting files

It serves as the **single source of truth** for all code, assets, and team members.

---

## Purpose of Version Control
The main goal of version control is to maintain a complete history of changes and allow developers to:
- Revert or roll back to earlier versions
- Recover from errors or bugs
- Work safely without fear of losing progress

---

## Real-World Example
Version control works similarly to auto-save and restore features in word processing applications. Just as users can revert to earlier document versions, developers can restore earlier versions of code.

## Key Features

### Revision History
- Records every change made in a project
- Allows rollback to stable versions
- Increases confidence during development

### Identity Tracking
- Each change is linked to the developer who made it
- Shows who changed what and when

### Collaboration
- Enables multiple developers to work on the same project
- Tracks and manages team contributions

### Peer Review
- Developers submit code for review
- Team members provide feedback before merging changes
- Improves code quality

### Automation and Efficiency
- Supports automated testing and deployment
- Helps ensure new changes do not break existing functionality

---

## Version Control in DevOps
Version control plays a key role in DevOps by supporting continuous integration, testing, and deployment. It helps teams deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably.

---

## Version Control in Agile Development
Agile teams work in short iterations, usually two weeks. Version control helps manage frequent changes, collaboration, and testing throughout each iteration.

---

## Benefits of Version Control
- Safe change tracking
- Easy rollback and recovery
- Clear accountability
- Better collaboration
- Faster and more reliable development

---

## Conclusion
Version control is an essential tool for every developer. It supports teamwork, improves software quality, and forms the foundation of modern software development.
