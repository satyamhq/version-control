# Remote vs Local in GitHub

## Overview
- Before the internet, sharing and backing up project files required manual copying
- Cloud platforms like GitHub make collaboration fast and efficient
- Git allows developers to work locally and synchronize with remote repositories

---

## Local Repository
- A **local repository** exists on your personal machine
- Accessible only to you
- You can:
  - Edit files
  - Commit changes
  - Work offline
- Changes stay local until pushed to a remote repository

---

## Remote Repository
- A **remote repository** is hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub)
- Identified by a unique URI (URL)
- Accessible only to users with permission
- Used for collaboration and backup
- Common remote name: `origin`

---

## Key Git Terms
- **Clone** – Copy a remote repository to your local machine
- **Pull** – Fetch latest changes from remote to local
- **Push** – Send local commits to the remote repository
- **Repo** – Short for repository

---

## Local vs Remote Workflow
1. Project exists on GitHub (remote)
2. User clones or pulls it to local machine
3. User modifies files locally
4. Changes are committed locally
5. Changes are pushed to remote
6. Other users must pull to see updates

---

## Advantage of Local Work
- You can work offline
- Commits can be made without internet
- Push only when ready

---

## Creating a Local-Only Repository
```bash
mkdir my-second-repo
cd my-second-repo
git init
