# What is Git and GitHub

## Version Control
- Version control systems track changes made to files over time
- Commonly used in software and web development
- Allows developers to:
  - View past versions
  - Compare changes
  - Revert to earlier versions
- Similar to app updates on a phone where new features or layouts appear

---

## Git
- **Git** is a **version control system**
- Used to track changes in files within a project
- Created by **Linus Torvalds**
- Originally designed to manage changes in the Linux kernel
- Handles large projects with thousands of contributors

### Benefits of Git
- Fast and high performance
- Reliable change tracking
- Free and open-source
- Simple and accessible command syntax
- Mostly used through the command line

## Git Repository
- A repository (repo) stores:
  - Project files
  - Complete history of changes
- Helps track who changed what and when
