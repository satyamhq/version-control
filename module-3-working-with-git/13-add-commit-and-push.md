Add, Commit, and Push

## Overview
This guide explains the common workflow of transferring **local changes** to a **remote GitHub repository** using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

This learning activity is designed as a **reflective, question-based walkthrough**, similar to the Coursera Coach interactive experience, helping you apply Git concepts to real scenarios.

## Scenario

1. Track those changes
2. Save them locally
3. Upload them to a remote GitHub repository

```bash
git status
