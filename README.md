# Version Control

## Overview
This repository explains how software developers collaborate on shared projects using version control systems. It focuses on organizing code, tracking changes, and avoiding conflicts when multiple contributors work on the same codebase.

The repository also introduces basic Linux command-line operations for managing files and creating automated workflows. In addition, it demonstrates how Git and GitHub are used in real-world development to store code, manage revisions, and collaborate efficiently.
